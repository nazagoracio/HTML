  <blockquote>Men are like steel. When they lose their temper, they lose their worth. A lot of times people look at the negative side of what they feel they can't do. I always look on the positive side of what I can do.<br/> Violence is my last option.<br/> People
    need to realise what real happiness and success is, because success as an actor is fleeting. You can be up there one day and gone the next.<br/>
